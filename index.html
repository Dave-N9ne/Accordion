                                Blueprints are templates we developed to make it super easy and straightforward to create interactive shoppable videos on the eko platform. We currently offer Blueprints in two categories: Product Finders – which help shoppers explore different options and choose the right fit for them. Product Demos – which help shoppers explore specific products and learn everything they need to know about them before they purchase. Each Blueprint was designed to positively impact eCommerce KPIs such as Add To Cart, On-Site Engagement and even Inventory Control. Check out our Blueprint Library to learn more about what they can do for you.

                                Today’s online experiences don’t stand out or guide customers to the right products for them. We created Blueprints to help online retailers differentiate themselves in a competitive market, bring digital experiences closer to real life, and boost business results. Plus, when customers actively shape their shopping journeys, you leverage zero-party data to gain first-hand knowledge on their preferences and behavior right when they choose to purchase.
